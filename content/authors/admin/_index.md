I am an Investment Risk Manager at Pictet Asset Management in Geneva, Switzerland. I am part of the Fixed Income Investment Risk team. Our mission is to enhance the decisions of investment teams by providing quantitative analyses. Previously I obtained a PhD in Economics, specifically in Financial Econometrics. I develop models for time series of realized (co)variances of financial assets. These models are useful in portfolio optimization, asset pricing, and quantitative risk management.
